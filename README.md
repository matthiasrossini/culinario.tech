# 4 - Instructions for collaboration

BEFORE STARTING
- installed application & virtualenv as specified above
- ``` git pull ```
- enter virtualenv 

1. Test pushing and pulling:
- ``` git pull ```
- #add a new file/change e.g. touch test.txt
- add all changes: ``` git add . ```
- ``` git commit -m "name's first commit" ```
- ``` git push ```

2. Working with branches
- look at available branches: ``` git branch -a``` 
- create a new branch and access it: ``` git checkout -b <branch-name> ```
- access branch: ``` git checkout ```
- check status of branch ``` git status ```
- merge branch: ``` git merge ```

# 5 - To run on Cloud

<br>

To run the app on Google Cloud, you will need a GCP Account with a running instance, bucket and SQL. 

Then branch from the main branch to the GCP branch (damian_gcp_final) and create your own secrets.py keys according to your own GCP setup. 

The keys you will need from your SQL instance are: SQL_PASSWORD, SQL_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS, SQL_DATABASE_NAME
e.g. SQL_PASSWORD = "password", SQL_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS = "00.000.000.00", SQL_DATABASE_NAME = "Foody"

Now you should be able to copy your project to your Google Cloud Server (SCP) and run it via the IP address there. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
